[Exploring OpenAI](https://setkyar.com/exploring-openai)

- [ask](./ask/main.py) is for asking questions to AI
- [grammar](./grammar/main.py) is asking AI to fix grammar. Added prefix for asking grammar check.
- [voice-ai](./vocie-ai) is asking via voice and answering with voice. A bit crappy, but quite fun to explore.
